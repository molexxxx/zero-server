# Upload a directory of Python distributions to PyPI, in the order that gets a working
# install soonest, waiting out the new-project cap when PyPI says it will lift soon.
#
# PyPI caps how many new projects an account may create in a window, and a release that
# introduces a package per capability runs past it. A refusal carries the policy that
# tripped and the seconds until it resets, so this makes one pass: files for projects
# that already exist go first, since adding a file to a project is never capped; then
# the projects that do not exist yet, most important first, so `pip install zero-server`
# works as early as possible. A "too many new projects" answer whose reset fits the
# wait budget is slept through and retried; one that does not ends the pass, and
# whatever is left is printed for the scheduled backfill, which runs this again. A file
# PyPI refuses for any other reason is reported with PyPI's full answer and skipped, so
# one bad file does not hold back the projects behind it; the pass still fails at the end.
#
#   pypi-upload.sh <dist directory> <version>
#
# PYPI_WAIT_BUDGET is the seconds this pass may spend waiting for the cap, 1800 default.
#
# Exits 0 when every distribution is on PyPI or the only ones missing were capped, and 1
# when an upload failed for any other reason.
