//! What a build carries: the crates a named feature set of the `zero-server` crate compiles.
//!
//! The framework's design claim is that a build pays only for the capabilities it names.
//! This measures that claim instead of asserting it. Each row below is a feature set a
//! consumer would plausibly ask for, resolved with `cargo tree`, which applies the same
//! feature unification the compiler does; the resolve graph in `cargo metadata` does not,
//! and reports optional crates a build never compiles.
//!
//! The counts are resolved for one fixed target, [`TARGET`], because a dependency graph is
//! platform-specific: the same feature set can resolve to one more crate on Windows than
//! on Linux, which would make a committed table fail its own check on another machine.
//! With the target pinned the counts are lockfile-derived, identical everywhere, and can be
//! committed. `cargo xtask docs` renders them into a `<!-- table: builds -->` region and
//! `cargo xtask docs --check` fails when they drift, so the published numbers cannot rot.
//! The compiled engine each binding ships is measured separately by
//! [`report`], because an artifact's size depends on the platform
//! and toolchain that produced it.
